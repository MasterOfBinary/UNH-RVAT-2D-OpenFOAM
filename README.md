UNH-RVAT 2D OpenFOAM case
=========================

OpenFOAM (2.3.x) case files for a 2D RANS simulation of the UNH-RVAT cross-flow
turbine in a towing tank. The simulation uses the `pimpleDyMFoam` solver and the
`kOmegaSST` turbulence model.

Thanks to Boloar from the cfd-online forums for providing a nice example case on
which to base this one. Also thanks to vkrastev for additional advice.
